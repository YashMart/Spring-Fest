                I believe myself to be an avid reader with the Inkworld Trilogy being my favourite seris till date, closely followed by Harry Potter Series. My last series was A Song of Ice and Fire.

                My second favorite pastime is close to my first favorite pastime, that is writing, I love writing and it is what gave me solace even in my JEE days.
